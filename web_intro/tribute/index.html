        <h1 class="intro">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="list-item"> August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. 
        A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
        Regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, 
        Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star,
         a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 
         the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
         Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. 
        </p>
        <p class="list-item"></pclass>Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was recognized as the top American high-school 
            basketball player while at Lower Merion. The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected 
            by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer
             by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>(1999 - 2002)</strong>Phil Jackson arrives and the three-peat The Lakers had been a playoff team with Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal, but they hadn’t quite reached championship form. The furthest they’d made it was to the conference finals. That all changed when Phil Jackson arrived. Jackson had already won six league titles with the Chicago Bulls. He’d twice won three in a row. Bryant and Shaq helped him accomplish it a third time. The Lakers knocked off the Indiana Pacers in 2000, Philadelphia 76ers in 2001 and the New Jersey Nets in 2002 for the NBA crown. </p></li>
                <li><p><strong>(2006)</strong> Career-high 81 points On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors. It’s the second-highest points total in a single game in league history. Wilt Chamberlain set the record with 100 points in 1962. Bryant shot 26-of-46 from the field, including draining seven from beyond the arch.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>(2008) </strong>Olympian The United States Men’s Basketball team suffered a humiliating finish in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Despite being the overwhelming favorites to win the gold medal, the squad only earned the bronze. That changed when Bryant joined the squad ahead of the 2008 Summer games in Beijing. In eight games, Bryant averaged 15 points. He erupted for 13 points in the final quarter of the gold-medal game against Spain, which the Americans won 118-107.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>(2008 - 2010)</strong> Return to championship form Bryant was already a three-time champion, but he had never won one without Shaq. O’Neal had gone on to win another title in Miami. And the supporting cast Bryant had played with since O’Neal’s departure was never nearly as talented. But when the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol in February 2008, Bryant’s fortunes changed for the better. The Lakers went on to finish 57-25 and advanced all the way to the NBA Finals. In the end, the Boston Celtics won the series, 3-2. But it was the last time anyone would best Bryant in the finals.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>(2012)</strong>Final Olympic medal Bryant donned the red, white and blue for the final time in 2012. He won his final gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. At 33, he was an aging star. But he still saw minutes in all eight games and helped the Americans run the table again</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>(2016)</strong> ‘Dear Basketball’/Retirement Bryant spent the rest of his career chasing a sixth NBA title, which would have tied him with Michael Jordan. But injuries plagued him his final few seasons. On Nov. 29, 2015, Bryant published a poem in The Players Tribune, titled “Dear Basketball.” In it, he announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season. On April 13, 2016, Bryant played in his final NBA game. But it wasn’t a declining star’s melancholy limp across the finish line. Bryant came to play. He scored a season-high 60 points in the Lakers’ 101-96 win over the Utah Jazz.</p></li>
